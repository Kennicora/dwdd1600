  <h1>Rappelling Overview</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Rappelling, also known as abseiling, is the controlled descent down a rock face or cliff
    using a rope. It is commonly practiced in canyoneering, rock climbing, mountaineering,
    and rescue operations. Utah’s red rock country provides some of the most spectacular
    locations in the world for rappelling and slot canyon exploration.
